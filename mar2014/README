Steps to run the inverse model:

SETUP
1. Run csadj.m to generate adjoing Green's functions for each sediment core. This takes about 30 min per core on glacier.

2. Run saveDls.m. This interpolates data and constructs covariance matrices and saves them in Dlsfile.mat

3. Run mkfulls.m. This generate a precursor for mkG.

4. Run saveGbpusv.m. This computes and saves the singular vectors of the scaled G matrix (called by saveGbpusv.m) in file Gbpusv.mat.

RUN
1. Run ssvd.m. This takes an effective range parameter k specified in the code.
